A Simple game with two players, where each player starts with 3 heaps of 13 coins. Each player then takes it in turns to take a square number (1, 4, 9 etc) of coins from the other players heap. Extra rules are that a players turn cannot be skipped and they must pick at least one coin from their opponents heap. The winning conditions are that the player that takes the final coin wins.
